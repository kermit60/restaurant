> A live deployment of this [`restaurant`](https://kermit60.github.io/restaurant/) project is available on GitHub pages.

However, if you want to run the application and/or edit it's source code locally, feel free to:

## **What I learned**
* How to use and run scripts that help host the server and update the live preview of the project
* Learned how to dynamically update page contents
* Dividing sections of the webpage into simpler modules so that it's own functionality can be in separate from the main file
